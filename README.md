# STATS220

This is my repo for STATS 220. 

A little about me:

- I am undertaking a degree in **computer science** 💻
- I am taking STATS 220 because I'm **fascinated** by how data can uncover patterns, tell insightful stories, and drive smarter decisions 📊
- I am interested in learning about the **what, why, and how** of data - what are we collecting, why are we collecting it, and how we analyse/interpret it 🔍

A meme that captures how I currently feel about my university studies is:
