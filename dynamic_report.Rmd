## How distracted was I during my study sessions?

Curious about how often I check my phone while studying? Well, let's take a look and find out together! &#x1F4F1;

Oh, and just a friendly reminder - please don't judge me too harshly on whether I'm a good or bad student based on this. Promise? &#x1F605;

```{r}
library(tidyverse)

csv_file <- "https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vTwy0kVghXbFIgFpE915yWlyIMiyFWunFn7_es20b8BheGEyYV3wjb3RXKqv2JM7w8nyMJ5QazTIslX/pub?gid=380314049&single=true&output=csv"

logged_data <- read_csv(csv_file)

latest_data <- logged_data %>%
  rename(timestamp = 1,
         consent = 2,
         study_day = 3,
         start_time = 4,
         study_duration = 5,
         phone_usage = 6,
         usage_count = 7,
         first_usage = 8,
         usage_length = 9,
         usage_activities = 10,
         usage_reason = 11,
         feeling = 12,
         focus_aid = 13)

latest_data_longer <- latest_data %>%
  separate_rows(usage_activities, sep = ", ")

# Value 1: Find out the total count of study sessions
session_count <- nrow(latest_data)

# Value 2: Find out the total study hours
study_total_hour <- (sum(latest_data$study_duration) / 60) %>% 
  round(1)

# Value 3: Find out the total count of phone usage occurrences per study hour
usage_per_hour <- (sum(latest_data$usage_count, na.rm = TRUE) / study_total_hour) %>%
  round(0)

```

### Are you ready?

In total, I have done **`r session_count`** study sessions so far, and that is a total of **`r study_total_hour`** hours of focused study! On average, I have picked up my phone **`r usage_per_hour`** times per study hour. 

Do you reckon I was focused enough? &#x1F60A;

Surprisingly, in some of my study sessions, I didn't touch my phone even once! But overall, I found myself picking up my phone during most of my study sessions.


```{r}

# Bar chart 1: Comparison of phone usage (Used vs. Not used)
# This chart shows how many times the phone was used and not used during study sessions
ggplot(data = latest_data) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = phone_usage),
           fill = "#B6DEE3",
           color = "#000000") +
  labs(title = "Phone Usage During Study Sessions",
       subtitle = "Comparing how many times the phone was used vs. not used",
       x = "Phone Usage (Yes or No)",
       y = "Count of Occurrences")

```

What did I do when I use my phone? Hmm...

Most of the time, I was engaged in communication, such as messaging friends or making phone calls. Entertainment is also noticeable, where I used my phone for listening to music or checking on the mobile game that I have been playing. It follows by study-related activities such as using dictionary (FYI, I am studying Korean right now!), checking tasks, and organising my study TO-DOs. 

As you can see from the chart, I'm not a big fan of social media or online shopping. Just not my thing! &#x1F605;


``` {r}

# Bar chart 2: Phone usage activities
# This chart shows what activities I used on phone during study sessions
ggplot(data = na.omit(latest_data_longer)) +
  geom_bar(aes(y = usage_activities),
           fill = "#A6CEE3", 
           color = "#000000") +
  labs(title = "Phone Usage Activities During Study Sessions",
       subtitle = "A breakdown of activities used on the phone while studying",
       x = "Count of Occurrences",
       y = "Activity Type")

```

Well, most of the time I picked up my phone because I received a notification. But there were also moments that I hit a difficult point in studies and feeling like a pause. Or sometimes, I just needed a mental break from all the intense studying (computer science is fun, but to be honest, it can be challenging!). 

Also, there might be some other reasons but yet to be discovered... &#x1F60A;

``` {r}

# Bar chart 3: Phone usage triggering reasons
# This chart shows the factors that triggered phone usage during study sessions
ggplot(data = na.omit(latest_data)) +
  geom_bar(aes(x = usage_reason),
           fill = "#A6BEE3",
           color = "#000000") +
  labs(title = "Reasons For Phone Usage During Study Sessions",
       subtitle = "A breakdown of factors triggering phone usage while studying",
       x = "Usage Reason",
       y = "Count of Occurrences")

```

Alright, time for getting back to studying! &#x1F4D6;
